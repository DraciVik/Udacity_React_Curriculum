# My Reads React app

My Reads is a simple React cataloging app which allows you to place a book on one of three shelfs:

1. Currently Reading;
2. Want To Read;
3. Read;

It also allows you to search for books by their name or tags (Currently has only a few predetermined tags) which can be found [here](SEARCH_TERMS.md)
